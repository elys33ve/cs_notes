somewhat unorganized notes or code from cs courses and assignments


some snippets of code from labs, or txt files of notes on syntax, process, etc.
it isn't very organized since some of these were just used like scratch paper

perhaps i'll come back to make them neater and more coherent at some point, but for now they're mostly just for personal reference
